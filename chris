Motivation behind Cloud Native
Introduction
As we dive into the realm of cloud-native technologies, understanding the motivation behind its inception and adoption is pivotal for newcomers. Over the past decade and a half, there has been a noticeable transformation in application architecture and development processes. This change is primarily due to the demands of the industry for more efficient, scalable, and resilient systems which led to the rise of cloud-native technologies. In this document, we'll navigate through the history, core components, and the significant advancements in technology that gave rise to cloud-native practices, offering insights into why and how these practices have become integral in the modern tech landscape.

Historical Context
In the early days of computing, applications were relatively simple with straightforward architectures, designed to run on standalone computers. These applications were monolithic in nature, meaning that they were composed of tightly interconnected components and were deployed as single units. During this era, developers wrote code that was closely tied to the underlying hardware.

However, with the advent of the internet, there was a surge in the number of users accessing applications. The need for applications that could handle multiple users simultaneously led to the development of distributed architectures. Distributed systems allowed applications to run on multiple machines or servers, providing scalability and improved performance.

Example: Facebook’s Evolution
Facebook, initially, was developed as a simple, monolithic application during its launch in 2004. As the user base expanded exponentially, the simple architecture couldn’t sustain the growing load and complexity of features being added. The company had to reconsider and re-architect its entire system to accommodate this growth. This led to the breaking down of the monolithic architecture into microservices, each handling specific functionalities and communicating over the network. This change allowed Facebook to scale its services efficiently, providing a seamless experience to its billions of users worldwide. This shift in architecture is a classic example of how applications evolved over time to handle increased load and complexity, providing valuable insights into the necessity for adopting new architectural practices like cloud-native.

This transition from monolithic to distributed architectures wasn't smooth. Early distributed systems faced numerous challenges, including network latency, partitioning, and the need for effective communication protocols among different system components. Addressing these challenges required a fundamental rethinking of how applications were designed, developed, and deployed, paving the way for the adoption of cloud-native practices.

The advent of cloud-native technologies provided solutions to these challenges, offering a set of practices that allowed for scalable, resilient, and efficient applications that could leverage the power of distributed architectures effectively. Understanding this historical context is crucial for appreciating the value and importance of cloud-native technologies in the contemporary tech landscape.
